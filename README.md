## Notes
Please contact us if the database needs to be updated, one must pull manually from the current CourseInformation site.

## Current Bugs

* Courses scheduled at the same time overlap, instead of appearing side-by-side.
* The CRN table doesn't look right.

## To-do list

* Add descriptions to section selection windows, that way people know what class they're signing up for
* Add RateMyProfessor links to each professor's name systematically?
* Reframe schedule for extra early / late classes (we *love* everything that our 30-minute in-between class period does, right?)
* Add 12-hour time

## Develop
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ndemarchis/no8am-3 && cd no8am-3
npm install
npm start
```
